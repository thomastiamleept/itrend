MEDICAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE DATASET
----------------------------------
Note from the authors:

Due to privacy reasons, we are unable to provide the actual emergency response dataset.
This is small sample of the said dataset, anonymized and irrelevant details removed,
but sufficient to demonstrate the properties of iTREND seen in the article. As such,
extracted trends here may slightly vary from the actual trends found from the original dataset.
